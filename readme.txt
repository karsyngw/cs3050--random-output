How to Compile and Run Files

    Should Include: function.c  (containing functions)
                    main.c      (containing "main" function)
                    test.txt    (file of values used in test function)
2. Compile files using: gcc main.c
    If using different main function, "#include function.c" in file, compile with: gcc (yourfile).c
